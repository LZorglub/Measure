The centimetre-gram-second system (abbreviated CGS or cgs) is a metric system of
physical units based on centimetre as the unit of length, gram as a unit of mass,
and second as a unit of time. 
All CGS mechanical units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, 
but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover 
electromagnetism.
